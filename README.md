<h2> HBNH command interpreter </h2>
<h3 style="color:red;">What's a command interpreter?</h3>
Do you remember the Shell? It's exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object, manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.
This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
